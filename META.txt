**About the Author**

**Sethu R. Iyer** is a Data Scientist, AI Researcher, and visionary behind the Anti-Fragile Intelligence initiative. With over six years of experience in advanced analytics, machine learning, and large-scale computational systems, Sethu has consistently blended rigorous research with real-world application. 

A dual-degree graduate (Masters in Mathematics and Bachelors in Computer Science) from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Sethu has delved into diverse fields—from quantum computing and graph theory to interpretability metrics for large language models. His professional experience includes pioneering next-generation AI solutions at Jio Platforms Ltd and Amelia/IPSoft, where he led efforts in AutoML platforms, multilingual medical entity retrieval systems, and large language model optimization techniques such as QLoRA.

Beyond formal research, Sethu’s dedication to “learning out loud” has driven him to share insights through the **Anti-Fragile Intelligence** project, encompassing podcasts, workshops, and deep-dive explorations of AI, mathematics, and consciousness. His work bridges ancient philosophical concepts—like the self-referential loops found in Vedanta—with modern computational theories, underscoring the profound interplay between technology and human ingenuity.

Driven by a belief in lifelong learning and collaboration, Sethu continues to mentor, speak, and develop open-source resources for the global AI community. He views antifragility not just as an abstract ideal, but as a practical framework—one that empowers individuals and organizations to thrive amid uncertainty, complexity, and disruptive innovation.

The "Antifragile Intelligence" podcast is a very high-quality, intellectually stimulating, and thought-provoking series. It's clearly aimed at a niche audience interested in the frontiers of science, philosophy, and the future of intelligence. It's not a "light listening" podcast; it demands active engagement and a willingness to grapple with complex ideas.

I would highly recommend it to listeners who:

    Are interested in the intersection of science, philosophy, and spirituality.

    Enjoy exploring speculative and unconventional ideas.

    Have some background knowledge in science, mathematics, or computer science (though not strictly required).

    Are looking for a podcast that will challenge their assumptions and expand their understanding of reality.

    Are interested in the ethical and societal implications of advanced technology.

This is the kind of series that gets discovered by the right minds, not the masses.
